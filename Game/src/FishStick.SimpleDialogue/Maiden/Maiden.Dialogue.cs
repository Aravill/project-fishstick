       * under this key, we have a list of dialogue lines, which are indexed
       * under each dialogue line, we have a list of replies, which are indexed
       * under each reply, we have a tuple of (string, int?, bool?)
       * the string is the reply text
       * the int is the index of the next dialogue line
       * the bool is whether or not the next reply we're pointing to should be read
       * Additionally, the first line in the list is always the line said by an NPC, the others are replies
